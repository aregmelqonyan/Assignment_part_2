1. Cheap Crowdfunding Problem
Solution Explanation:

    The function aims to find the smallest positive integer that has not yet been
    pledged. The approach leverages the following steps:

    1. Convert the pledge_list to a set:
        - The main reason for converting the list to a set is to optimize the look-up time 
            for checking whether a particular amount has already been pledged. In Python, 
            lookups in a set take average O(1) time, while lookups in a list take O(n) time.
        - Since we only care about whether an amount is present or not (and not about the 
            order or frequency of elements), using a set is more efficient.

    2. Initialize 'least_amount' to 1:
        - Start with the smallest possible pledge amount, which is 1.

    3. Iterate through increasing values of 'least_amount':
        - If the current 'least_amount' is found in the set, increment it and continue checking.
        - As soon as we find a 'least_amount' that is not in the set, this is the smallest 
            unique pledge amount that we can use.

    4. Return 'least_amount':
        - This is the smallest amount that hasn't been pledged yet, ensuring the pledge is valid
            and fulfills the condition of being unique.

    Example:
    If pledge_list = [1, 8, 7, 9], the function will return 2, as it's the smallest positive 
    integer that is not in the list.

2. Extract Titles from RSS feed
Solution Explanation:

    This Python script is designed to extract and print headlines from an RSS feed,
    specifically from Google News.
    
    1. Importing Libraries:
        . BeautifulSoup is a library from bs4 that allows parsing of HTML and XML documents.
          It's particularly useful for web scraping.
        . BeautifulSoup uses lxml to parse the XML content. lxml is a powerful library for 
          processing XML and HTML documents.
        . requests is a library for making HTTP requests. It simplifies sending HTTP requests to
          web pages or APIs and handles the response.

    2. Parsing the RSS Feed with BeautifulSoup:
            The response text (which is XML in this case) is passed to BeautifulSoup for parsing.
            The features="xml" argument tells BeautifulSoup to use the XML parser.

    3. Extracting the Titles:
        . soup.find_all("item") finds all <item> elements in the XML, which represent individual news articles.
        . The list comprehension [item.title.text for item in soup.find_all("item")] extracts the text 
          content of the <title> tags within each <item>. These titles are stored in the titles list.
        . The function returns the list of titles, which can then be printed or further processed.

3. Streaming Payments Processor
Solution Explanation:

    1. Custom Wrapper Class (Storage):
        . The code defines a custom class ChecksumStorageWrapper that wraps the original storage
          instance obtained from get_payments_storage().
        . This class adds a checksum attribute, which is initialized to 0.
    
    2. Writing Data, Calculating Checksum and getting the checksum:
        . The write() method of ChecksumStorageWrapper takes the data (which is a sequence of bytes),
          sums the bytes using sum(data), and adds this sum to the checksum attribute.
        . After calculating the checksum for the data, it writes the data to the underlying storage.
        . The get_checksum() method returns the final value of the checksum after all data has been
          written to the storage.
    
    3. Using the Wrapper in process_payments():

        . The process_payments() function creates an instance of ChecksumStorageWrapper by wrapping
          the storage object obtained from get_payments_storage().
        . The stream_payments_to_storage() function is called with this wrapped storage, which writes data 
          to the storage while calculating the checksum simultaneously.
        . Finally, the checksum is printed using the print() function.
    

    Restrictions:
        . Single Call to Each Function: The solution respects the requirement of only making one call
          to get_payments_storage() and stream_payments_to_storage().
        . No Temporary Storage: The checksum is calculated on the fly, without the need for temporary 
          storage or holding all data in memory.
        . Preserving Functionality: The original functionality of streaming payments to storage is
          preserved, while adding the new requirement of calculating and printing the checksum.


4. Streaming Payments Processor, two vendors edition.
Solution Explanation:

    1. payment_generator Function:

        . Purpose: Acts as an intermediary that accumulates payments in a queue and yields them 
          one by one when store_payments() requests them.
        . Queue (payments): This list temporarily holds payments as they are streamed in by
          stream_payments() and before they are consumed by store_payments().
        . Callback (add_amount): A nested function inside payment_generator that stream_payments()
          will call to add each payment amount to the payment_queue.
        . Streaming Payments: The stream_payments(add_amount) call triggers the streaming process,
          filling up payments queue with payments.
        . Yielding Payments: The while loop keeps yielding payments from the queue until all payments are
          processed and the queue is empty.

    2. Connecting the Functions:

        The payment_generator() function is passed as an argument to store_payments(),
        effectively bridging the gap between the two vendor functions.
    
    Restriction:
        . Single Call Limitation: The solution makes only one call each to stream_payments()
          and store_payments(), as required.
        . No Disk Usage: The solution avoids using disk storage by keeping payments in memory
          within the payment_queue.
        . Limited Memory Handling: By yielding payments one at a time and immediately removing
          them from the queue, the memory usage remains controlled, adhering to the system's limitations.
